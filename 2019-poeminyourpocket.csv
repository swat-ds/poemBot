1,Null Point,Gabrielle Calvocoressi,"The first thing I learned was to look wide
at the darkness

and not want anything. He’d say, ""Just look
at the darkness

and tell me what you see."" I’d say, ""I see stars"" or
""Just the stars, Dad.""

And he’d say, ""Don’t call them that yet. What do you see?""
""Just the stars, Dad.""

But then I’d be quiet and let my eyes go and look wide
at the darkness.

It was like a dome. I think it frightened me to stare
at the darkness.

""I see light. I see a million little lights."" And he’d say
""They aren’t all stars.""

Some were planets and some were planes and I’d say, Yeah,
they aren’t all stars.

But not really believe it. But say it so not to feel stupid out there
in the darkness.","From Rocket Fantastic (Persea Books, 2017). Copyright © 2017 by Gabrielle Calvocoressi. Used with the permission of the author.",
2,Remember,Joy Harjo,"Remember the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star’s stories.
Remember the moon, know who she is. 
Remember the sun’s birth at dawn, that is the 
strongest point of time. Remember sundown 
and the giving away to night.
Remember your birth, how your mother struggled 
to give you form and breath. You are evidence of 
her life, and her mother’s, and hers.
Remember your father. He is your life, also. 
Remember the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.
Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have their 
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them, 
listen to them. They are alive poems.
Remember the wind. Remember her voice. She knows the 
origin of this universe.
Remember you are all people and all people
are you.
Remember you are this universe and this 
universe is you.
Remember all is in motion, is growing, is you. 
Remember language comes from this. 
Remember the dance language is, that life is.

Jackrabbits, green onions & witches stew

Dinky planet on a skateboard of dynamite

4,The Map,Marie Howe,"The failure of love might account for most of the suffering in the world.

The girl was going over her global studies homework

in the air where she drew the map with her finger


touching the Gobi desert,


the Plateau of Tiber in front of her,


and looking through her transparent map backwards

I did suddenly see,

how her left is my right, and for a moment I understood.","Copyright © 2016 by Marie Howe. Originally published in Poem-a-Day on October 27, 2016.",
5,Instructions on Not Giving Up,Ada Limón,"More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out
of the crabapple tree, more than the neighbor’s
almost obscene display of cherry limbs shoving
their cotton candy-colored blossoms to the slate
sky of Spring rains, it’s the greening of the trees
that really gets to me. When all the shock of white
and taffy, the world’s baubles and trinkets, leave
the pavement strewn with the confetti of aftermath, 
the leaves come. Patient, plodding, a green skin 
growing over whatever winter did to us, a return
to the strange idea of continuous living despite
the mess of us, the hurt, the empty. Fine then,
I’ll take it, the tree seems to say, a new slick leaf
unfurling like a fist to an open palm, I’ll take it all.","Copyright © 2017 by Ada Limón. Originally published in Poem-a-Day on May 15, 2017.",
6,The Laughing Child,W. S. Merwin,"When she looked down from the kitchen window 
into the back yard and the brown wicker
baby carriage in which she had tucked me
three months old to lie out in the fresh air
of my first January the carriage
was shaking she said and went on shaking
and she saw I was lying there laughing
she told me about it later it was
something that reassured her in a life
in which she had lost everyone she loved 
before I was born and she had just begun
to believe that she might be able to
keep me as I lay there in the winter
laughing it was what she was thinking of
later when she told me that I had been
a happy child and she must have kept that 
through the gray cloud of all her days and now 
out of the horn of dreams of my own life
I wake again into the laughing child",From Garden Time. Copyright © 2016 by W. S. Merwin. Used by permission of Copper Canyon Press.,
7,Making History,Marilyn Nelson,"Blue and White Orlon Snow ake Sweater, Blue Snowpants, Red Galoshes 
—Smoky Hill AFB, Kansas, 1955

Somebody took a picture of a class
standing in line to get polio shots,
and published it in the Weekly Reader.
We stood like that today. And it did hurt.
Mrs. Liebel said we were Making History,
but all I did was sqwunch up my eyes and wince. 
Making History takes more than standing in line 
believing little white lies about pain.
Mama says First Negroes are History:
First Negro Telephone Operator,
First Negro Opera Singer At The Met,
First Negro Pilots, First Supreme Court Judge. 
That lady in Montgomery just became a First
by sqwunching up her eyes and sitting there.",Copyright © 2014 by Marilyn Nelson. From Split This Rock’s The Quarry: A Social Justice Poetry Database.,
8,The Rider,Naomi Shihab Nye,"A boy told me
if he roller-skated fast enough
his loneliness couldn’t catch up to him,
the best reason I ever heard
for trying to be a champion.
What I wonder tonight
pedaling hard down King William Street
is if it translates to bicycles.
A victory! To leave your loneliness
panting behind you on some street corner
while you  oat free into a cloud of sudden azaleas, 
pink petals that have never felt loneliness,
no matter how slowly they fell.",From Fuel. Copyright © 1998 by Naomi Shihab Nye. Used with the permission of BOA Editions.,
9,Utopian,Alicia Ostriker,"My neighbor’s daughter has created a city
you cannot see
on an island to which you cannot swim
ruled by a noble princess and her athletic consort 
all the buildings are glass so that lies are impossible 
beneath the city they have buried certain words 
which can never be spoken again
chiefly the word divorce which is eaten by maggots 
when it rains you hear chimes
rabbits race through its suburbs
the name of the city is one you can almost pronounce","Copyright © 2016 by Alicia Ostriker. Originally published in Poem-a-Day on April 22, 2016.",
10,When Giving Is All We Have,Alberto Ríos,"""One river gives
Its journey to the next.""

We give because someone gave to us. 
We give because nobody gave to us.

We give because giving has changed us.
We give because giving could have changed us.

We have been better for it, 
We have been wounded by it---

Giving has many faces: It is loud and quiet, 
Big, though small, diamond in wood-nails.

Its story is old, the plot worn and the pages too, 
But we read this book, anyway, over and again:

Giving is, first and every time, hand to hand, 
Mine to yours, yours to mine.

You gave me blue and I gave you yellow. 
Together we are simple green. You gave me

What you did not have, and I gave you 
What I had to give---together, we made

Something greater from the difference.",Copyright © 2014 by Alberto Ríos. Used with permission of the author.,
11,In Brazil,Tracy K. Smith,"Poets swagger up and down the shore, I’ll bet, 
Wagging their hips in time to the raucous tide. 
hey tip back their heads and life sears a path 
Down the throat. At night they dance, don’t they, 
Across tiles that might as well be glass, or ice.
And if they don’t want to spend the evening alone, 
They don’t. And if they want to wear snow-angels 
Into the sheets of some big empty bed, that’s 
What they do, until a dark form takes shape
On the ceiling overhead. Then they put on a robe 
And kick around looking for some slippers. 
When the poem finally arrives, it grins
And watches back with wide credulous eyes.",From Duende. Copyright © 2007 by Tracy K. Smith. Used with the permission of Graywolf Press.,
12,Unpacking a Globe,Arthur Sze,"I gaze at the Pacific and don’t expect 
to ever see the heads on Easter Island,

though I guess at sunlight rippling 
the yellow grasses sloping to shore;

yesterday a doe ate grass in the orchard: 
it lifted its ears and stopped eating

when it sensed us watching from
a glass hallway---in his sleep, a veteran

sweats, defusing a land mine.
On the globe, I mark the Battle of

the Coral Sea---no one frets at that now.
""A poem can never be too dark,""

I nod and, staring at the Kenai, hear 
ice breaking up along an inlet;

yesterday a coyote trotted across 
my headlights and turned his head

but didn’t break stride; that’s how 
I want to live on this planet:

alive to a rabbit at a glass door---
and flower where there is no flower.","Copyright © 2015 by Arthur Sze. Originally published in Poem-a-Day on April 10, 2015.",
13,Kissing in Vietnamese,Ocean Vuong,"My grandmother kisses
as if bombs are bursting in the backyard, 
where mint and jasmine lace their perfumes 
through the kitchen window,
as if somewhere, a body is falling apart
and flames are making their way back
through the intricacies of a young boy’s thigh, 
as if to walk out the door, your torso
would dance from exit wounds.
When my grandmother kisses, there would be 
no flashy smooching, no western music
of pursed lips, she kisses as if to breathe
you inside her, nose pressed to cheek
so that your scent is relearned
and your sweat pearls into drops of gold 
inside her lungs, as if while she holds 
you death also, is clutching your wrist.
My grandmother kisses as if history
never ended, as if somewhere
a body is still
falling apart.",Copyright © 2014 by Ocean Vuong. From Split This Rock’s The Quarry: A Social Justice Poetry Database.,
14,The Silver Thread,Afaa Michael Weaver,"The fern gathers where the water seldom goes 
unless the storms swell this world of wise choices, 
the loud trickle of clear tongues of the stream 
licking the edges of rock, while up ahead a curve 
hides tomorrow from our crystal ball, the thing 
we are afraid to admit we have, the guarantee
we hide from faith. In the woods our dog is lost 
from time to time, until suddenly we hear her paws 
inside winter’s death becoming the yearly promise 
of new undergrowth, her careless paws that beg 
each day for the next bowl of treats, true faith
in what love yields. The rain stops not long after
it threatens to soak us with cold and chills, the trees 
open to the gradual break of blue inside the gray, 
turning the clouds naked and white under the sun, 
the stream disappears under a bridge made by men 
so trucks can crawl back and forth over this road
of dirt with its one row of grass, where our tongues 
make a silver thread finding its way past the fear.","Copyright © 2017 Afaa Michael Weaver. Originally published in Poem-a-Day on November 27, 2017.",
15,Mosquito,Jane Hirshfield,"I say I
&
a small mosquito drinks from my tongue

but many say we and hear I
say you or he and
hear I

what can we do with this problem

a bowl held in both hands
cannot be filled by its holder

x, says the blue whale
x, say the krill
solve for y, says the ocean, then multiply by existence

the feet of an ant make their own sound on the earth 

ice is astonished by water

a person misreads
delirium as delphinium
and falls into
a blueness sleepy as beauty when sneezing

16,Storm Ending,Jean Toomer,"Thunder blossoms gorgeously above our heads, 
Great, hollow, bell-like flowers,
Rumbling in the wind,
Stretching clappers to strike our ears . . . 
Full-lipped flowers
Bitten by the sun
Bleeding rain
Dripping rain like golden honey—
And the sweet earth flying from the thunder.",,
17,Wild Swans,Edna St. Vincent Millay,"I looked in my heart while the wild swans went over. 
And what did I see I had not seen before?
Only a question less or a question more;
Nothing to match the flight of wild birds flying. 
Tiresome heart, forever living and dying,
House without air, I leave you and lock your door. 
Wild swans, come over the town, come over
The town again, trailing your legs and crying!",,
18,The Tropics of New York,Claude McKay,"Bananas ripe and green, and ginger root 
    Cocoa in pods and alligator pears,
And tangerines and mangoes and grape fruit, 
    Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs,

Sat in the window, bringing memories 
    of fruit-trees laden by low-singing rills,
And dewy dawns, and mystical skies 
    In benediction over nun-like hills.

My eyes grow dim, and I could no more gaze; 
    A wave of longing through my body swept,
And, hungry for the old, familiar ways
    I turned aside and bowed my head and wept.",,

today will be different, today 
I will do what I do what I must what I will 
today I will    efficient    today 
tasks completed    today    organized today 
my desk in order.
Today I will    different.
Do today as if some other un-waylaid by wind 
or whim or want. Someone of will, not wanton 
wondering. What song will you sing then when 
salsa flings you circumsolar when
lightslant leaps across your foot when
urgency, like sucking sand, slips seaward and 
beckons you to swim?",Previously published on the Visible Poetry blog in April 2017.,
