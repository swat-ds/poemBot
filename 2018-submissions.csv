one tea-wheel) white.
The wheel brings the bill, the bill --- bald.

Everyone goes in for the table,
the tablecloth is of water. One says huh --- one morning high on a grape I dropped off --- a dunce --- 
and exacted my height, and rightly so: it is a height I won't have made alone.
It is a height erring on all sides.

The bride slip'n slides on her back to us --- then on her head (a ball-point pen), quicksand in her hair.

A man beside her, his mouth is like a dark arch for her. My mouth is death to you!
In this new rhythm how can I say, how can I thank you, for I feel a blessing running through my tale now, it shines --- 
intestines --- that I will can.",Poetry (January 2017),Contributed by the author.

    who enter the water in turn by her line and furrow
    burrowing into the brand new folds which she has shown them

A good liver gives his life to others
    it is a meadow for grazing and he is a cud-stocker
    a source from which more than one may chew
    a bully-for- you and incongruous kin

A good skimmer gives their skimming to others
    they are long in limberness
    providing scarce warmth for the rather-go- hungry 1
    they are spongy

    As if the term “good” in its newly declared indices
    might unmistakably and generously mean
    that which is “available” - a value as complex
    and flexible as a friend
    A work that one tends toward but does not end
